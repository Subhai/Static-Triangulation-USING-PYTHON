# Static-Triangulation-USING-PYTHON
This Python-based Network Triangulation System is designed to determine the approximate location of a device or signal source based on signal strength, latency, or other network-based parameters. The code leverages triangulation algorithms to estimate positions accurately by using data from multiple reference points.

Key Features:
Multi-Point Data Collection: Utilizes at least three known reference points to calculate the target's position.
Signal Analysis: Can work with signal strength (RSSI), latency, or other network parameters for distance estimation.
Mathematical Accuracy: Implements trilateration techniques using Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy for precise calculations.
Customizability: Users can modify parameters to adapt the triangulation model to different use cases.
Real-Time Computation: Capable of real-time position estimation with network input data.
Possible Use Cases:
Locating devices in a WiFi or cellular network.
Enhancing indoor navigation and tracking systems.
Network security applications for detecting unauthorized devices.
This code serves as a foundational tool for network-based positioning and can be extended with additional features like machine learning-based enhancements or integration with mapping APIs.
